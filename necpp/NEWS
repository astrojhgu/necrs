Version 2.0 (alpha)

Introducing a new NEC parser. This uses ANTLR and now is fairly complete. It will have two modes, one is the compatability mode,
the other is a human readable format that is MUCH more explicit.

Version 1.5

Ruby improvements. New genetic algorithm for optimization.

Version 1.4

New Ruby module.
C library interface cleanup.


Version 1.3

Switched to Lapack as the main method for doing LU decomposition.
Many many bug fixes.

Version 1.2.9

Some improvements with the configure.in file. Now detects the atlas libraries for LAPACK and uses them. Still more to be done in this area.

Version 1.2.8

Much faster! We're now using LAPACK for the LU decomposition. On my laptop,
nec2++ -b produces 1.3 normally. 1.45 with basic blas, and 1.

Version 1.0.4

* Moved to AutoConf (Using KDevelop -- an excellent development environment)
* Nec++ is now available as a library (libnecpp.a) and can be called from within
other programs. See the example directory in the source distribution.
* Doxygen is being used for code documentation.
